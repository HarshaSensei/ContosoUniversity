# STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING ASP.NET FRAMEWORK

University Management  demonstrates how to use Entity Framework Core in an
ASP.NET Core MVC web application.

**Abstract**
The "Contoso University" project is a comprehensive Single Page Application (SPA) developed
using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. It is designed to emulate the
operations of a university management system, showcasing a robust and scalable
approach to web application development.
The application features modules for managing “Courses”, “Instructors”, “Departments”,
and “Students”, each accessible through an intuitive user interface. Users can perform
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these entities seamlessly. The SPA
platform integrates navigation and entity-specific actions into a unified experience,
enhancing usability and accessibility.
The project adheres to a clean architectural design, as seen in its structured solution
explorer layout. Controllers, models, and Razor views are logically organized to ensure
maintainability and scalability. Entity Framework Core is employed for database
interactions, supporting migrations and facilitating data handlingKey highlights include:
- “Courses Module”: Allows users to manage course details such as title, credits, and
department affiliations.
- “Instructors Module”: Provides tools for managing instructor records, including names,
hire dates, office assignments, and associated courses.
- “Departments Module”: Facilitates the management of department details, including
budgets, administrators, and starting dates.
- “Integrated SPA Interface”: Ensures smooth navigation and interaction within a single
platform, improving user experience.
The "Contoso University" project is ideal for demonstrating practical applications of modern web
development frameworks.
